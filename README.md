# samrCSS
samrCSS is a CSS framework with a bunch of built-in features to get your website to actually look good very fast.

## Take a look
Go to [samrcode.github.io/samrCSS](https://samrcode.github.io/samrCSS) to take a look at how samrCSS works.

## How to install
Just add a link to samr.css from your web pages.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samrcode/samrcss/main/samr.css" />
```

You can also download the CSS file and host it yourself.
However, if you choose this option, remember to also download bullet.gif and put it in the same directory as samr.css.

You do not need to download bulbon.gif and bulboff.gif.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/samr.css">
```

## Note
The bulbon.gif and bulboff.gif files are sourced from (W3Schools.com)[https://w3schools.com].
- [bulbon.gif](https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_bulbon.gif)
- [bulboff.gif](https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_bulboff.gif)

## Documentation
We are currently still working on the documentation.
If you'd like to see how samrCSS works, take a look at samr.css and index.html.

## Documentation
### Typefaces
samrCSS comes with 4 default typefaces.
I'm definitely adding more in the future.

- font-helvetica
- font-arial
- font-georgia
- font-mono

The mono typeface uses the browser's default monospace typeface.

#### Example
```html
<p class="font-helvetica">This is some text in Helvetica.</p>
<p class="font-arial">This is some text in Arial.</p>
<p class="font-georgia">This is some text in Georgia.</p>
<p class="font-mono">This is some text in the browser's default monospace typeface.</p>
```
### Colours
#### Absolute
These are the absolute colours. No extra stuff to make it more readable. Just make it truly red!

- c-abs-red (#ff0000)
- c-abs-green (#00ff00)
- c-abs-blue (#0000ff)
- c-abs-black (#000000)
- c-abs-white (#ffffff)
